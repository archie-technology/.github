## 🌿 Branch Naming Convention

To keep our development process clean and collaborative, we follow a consistent naming convention for all branches:

### 📌 Format

- `type` – describes the purpose of the branch
- `short-description` – a brief summary of the work (use kebab-case)

---

### 🏷️ Common Types

| Type         | Use For                                           | Example                               |
|--------------|---------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| `feature/`   | New features or functionality                     | `feature/login-form`                   |
| `fix/`       | Bug fixes                                         | `fix/user-auth-error`                  |
| `chore/`     | Non-user-facing tasks (e.g., setup, config)       | `chore/update-eslint-config`           |
| `docs/`      | Documentation updates                             | `docs/api-readme`                      |
| `hotfix/`    | Urgent production fixes                           | `hotfix/crash-on-launch`               |
| `refactor/`  | Code improvements without changing behavior       | `refactor/form-validation`             |
| `test/`      | Adding or fixing tests                            | `test/add-login-tests`                 |

---

### 💡 Bonus Tips

- Use **kebab-case** for readability: `feature/add-payment-gateway`
- Reference issue numbers if relevant: `fix/#42-profile-save-bug`
- Keep it short but descriptive
- Always branch off from `dev` (unless it's a `hotfix/`)

---

### ✅ Examples in Context

Let's say you're working on a few different tasks:

| Task                                   | Good Branch Name                     |
|----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Add a new profile settings page        | `feature/profile-settings`            |
| Fix an alignment bug in user cards     | `fix/user-card-alignment`             |
| Clean up validation logic              | `refactor/validation-helpers`         |
| Add documentation for the API routes   | `docs/api-route-guide`                |
| Urgent crash fix after deploy          | `hotfix/fix-null-ref-error`           |

---

Stick to these conventions so we all stay on the same page 🚀
